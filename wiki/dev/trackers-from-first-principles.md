# Bugs, Tasks, and Tickets from First Principles

Why do we track tasks?

* To communicate about what should, will, has, and will not be done.
    * Consequently, to either build consensus on what to do next or to dictate
      it.
* To measure and communicate progress.
* To preserve information.
    * Otherwise we'd just remember it in our heads.

Bugs/defects are a kind of task but not the only kind. Most teams have a "bug
tracker" that contains a lot more than bugs. Let's not let bugs dictate the
system.

* Therefore, "steps to reproduce" should not be a required datum.

Bugs are an _important_ kind of task.

Tasks can be related to software development artifacts: commits, versions,
builds, releases.

* A task may only be complete as of certain commits/releases/builds.
* A task may only be valid after (or before) certain commits/releases/builds.

Communication loosely implies publishing. Tracking doesn't, but may rely on
the publishing of other facts.
