# 12-Factor Apps

Some folks over at [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) wrote up their perceived best
practices for building “software as a service”-style applications and called
it [The Twelve-Factor App](http://www.12factor.net). It's a good read, and has
lots of good advice in it.

I have a few thoughts on it.

-----

* [III. Config](3-config)
* [VII. Port Binding](7-port-binding)

-----

At some point around sections 6 or 7, the goodness of the advice is overtaken
by the “be more like Heroku specifically”-ness of the advice, to the detriment
of their point.
