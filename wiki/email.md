# Why I Didn't Answer Your Email

![An email appears! Aww, man. Will I think differently after reading it? If
yes, then read immediately. If no, then will I act differently after reading
it? If yes, then read immediately. If no, then is it from someone funny? If
yes, then read immediately. If no, UNREAD FOREVER.](/media/email/flowchart.png)

I get a lot of email, often while I'm in [the middle of something
thought-intensive](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/).
Managing interruptions and my attention means I have to triage emails based on
only two things: who sent them, and what they wrote in the subject line. If I
didn't answer yours, it's probably not personal: I probably glanced at it when
it arrived and mentally put it on the “later” pile instead of the “now” pile,
and “later” can be a very long time indeed.

If it was actually important that I read and respond to your email, and I
couldn't tell that from the subject, what the hell is wrong with your writing?
If you can live without my reply, well, you're smart: work something out
without me. I'll probably think it's cool.
