# Why I Didn't Answer Your Email

![An email appears! Aww, man. Will I think differently after reading it? If
yes, then read immediately. If no, then will I act differently after reading
it? If yes, then read immediately. If no, then is it from someone funny? If
yes, then read immediately. If no, UNREAD FOREVER.](/media/email/flowchart)

I get a lot of email, usually whenever I'm in [the middle of something
thought-intensive](http://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/).
If I didn't answer yours, it's probably not personal: I probably glanced at
the subject line and the sender and mentally put it on the "later" pile
instead of the "now" pile. That pile is, effectively, a black hole.

If it was actually important that I read and respond to your email, and I
couldn't tell that from the subject, what the hell is wrong with your writing?
If you can live without my reply, well, you're smart: work something out
without me. I'll probably think it's cool.
