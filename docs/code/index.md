# Code

Pieces of code and code-adjacent work, with or without exposition, that don't quite fit into the library ecosystem, but which I enjoyed writing.

* [A Users, Roles & Privileges Scheme Using Graphs](users-rolegraph-privs.md) — An SQL schema and associated queries for handling permissions when roles can nest arbitrarily.

* [Configuring Browser Apps](configuring-browser-apps.md) — Notes on the available techniques for delivering runtime configuration to code running in a user's browser, and the tradeoffs involved.

* [Writing Good Commit Messages](commit-messages.md) — A style guide.

I also maintain a [Github account](https://github.com/ojacobson/) for more substantial projects.
