# Collected Advice about Git

* [git-config Settings You Want](config.md) — Git is highly configurable, and the defaults have gotten drastically better over the years, but there are still some non-default behaviours that I've found make life better.

* [Notes Towards Detached Signatures in Git](detached-sigs.md) — An idea I had, but never fully developed, for implementing after-the-fact object signing on top of Git. This was based on a similar feature in Monotone, which I'd found very effective for annotating commits on the fly.

* [Life With Pull Requests](pull-request-workflow.md) — Some notes I made while getting up to speed with pull requests to help my team come to grips with the workflows.

* [Git Is Not Magic](scratch.md) — An exploration of Git's on-disk data structures and the design choices taken very early in Git's existence.

* [Stop using `git pull` for deployment!](stop-using-git-pull-to-deploy.md) — Describing the least-painful way to use Git as a deployment tool I had worked out, circa 2014. Written in an aversarial style as a response to repeated ”why don't we just”s that, while well-intentioned, came from an incomplete understanding of what `git pull` does.

* [Git Survival Guide](survival.md) — Some words of caution about Git, `git`'s preferred workflows, and various recoverable mistakes.
