<p>The GPG software suite is a pretty elegant cryptosystem. It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A standard, well-maintained set of tools for creating and storing keys, and
  associating them with identities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A suite of reliable tools for encrypting, signing, decrypting, and
  verifying data that can be easily assembled into any combination of
  integrity checks, authenticity checks, and privacy management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A key distribution network that does not rely on hierarchal authority and
  that can be bootstrapped from scratch quickly and easily</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While GPG <a href="terrible">sucks in a number of important ways</a>, it's also the best
tool we have right now for restoring privacy to private correspondance over
the internet.</p>
<h2 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h2>
<p>Pretty much every Linux distribution relies on GPG for code signing. Rather
than using GPG's web-of-trust model for key distribution, however, code
signing with GPG usually creates a hierarchal PKI so that the root keys can
be shipped with the operating system.</p>
<p>This works shockingly well, and support for GPG is extremely well integrated
into common package management systems such as apt and yum.</p>
<h2 id="source-control">Source Control</h2>
<p>Which is basically code signing, admittedly, but even Git's support for GPG
is basically great. Tools like Fossil embed it even deeper, and work quite
well.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>GPG's integration with email is surprisingly clever, follows a number of
long-standing best practices for extending email, and does a <em>very</em> good job
of providing some guarantees that make sense in a not-terribly-long-ago view
of email as a communications medium. In particular, if</p>
<ul>
<li>who you talk to is not a secret, and</li>
<li>what, broadly, you are talking about is not a secret, but</li>
<li>the specifics of the discussion <em>are</em> a secret, and</li>
<li>all participants are using GPG on their own mailers</li>
</ul>
<p>then GPG works brilliantly and modern GPG integration is very effective.</p>
<p>These assumptions pretty accurately reflect the majority of email use up
through the late 90s and early 2000s: technical or personal correspondence
between known acquaintences.</p>
<p>The internet has moved on from email for casual correspondence, but that
doesn't invalidate the elegance of GPG's integration for GPG users.</p>
<h2 id="distributed-verification">Distributed Verification</h2>
<p>Even though GPG's trust model has some serious privacy costs and concerns, it
works as a great proof of concept for CA-free identity management. That's
huge: centralized CAs have even more onerous costs and worse risks than GPG's
trust network, while offering less transparency to help offset those costs.</p>
<p>Others have written some pretty interesting things on how to improve GPG's
trust model and make it less succeptible to errors or key leaks by
small-to-middling numbers of participants. <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030235.html">This
post</a>
to tor-talk last year is probably the most complete.</p>
