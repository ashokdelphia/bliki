<p>Why do we track tasks?</p>
<ul>
<li>To communicate about what should, will, has, and will not be done.<ul>
<li>Consequently, to either build consensus on what to do next or to dictate
  it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To measure and communicate progress.</li>
<li>To preserve information for future use.<ul>
<li>Otherwise we'd just remember it in our heads.</li>
<li>Wishlist tasks are not a bad thing!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Bugs/defects are a kind of task but not the only kind. Most teams have a “bug
tracker” that contains a lot more than bugs. Let's not let bugs dictate the
system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, “steps to reproduce” should not be a required datum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bugs are an <em>important</em> kind of task.</p>
<p>Tasks can be related to software development artifacts: commits, versions,
builds, releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>A task may only be complete as of certain commits/releases/builds.</li>
<li>A task may only be valid after (or before) certain commits/releases/builds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication loosely implies publishing. Tracking doesn't, but may rely on
the publishing of other facts.</p>
<h2 id="core-data">Core Data</h2>
<p>Tasks are only useful if they're actionable. To be actionable, they must be
understood. Understanding requires communication and documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>A protocol-agnostic <em>name</em>, for easily identifying a task in related
  conversations.<ul>
<li>These names need to be <em>short</em> since they're used conversationally. Long
  issue names will be shortened by convention whether the tracker supports
  it or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An actionable <em>description</em> of the task.<ul>
<li>Frequently, a short <em>summary</em> of the task, to ease bulk task
  manipulation. Think of the difference between an email subject and an
  email body.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <em>discussion</em>, consisting of <em>remarks</em> or <em>comments</em>, to track the evolving
  understanding alongside the task.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="#speciation">speciation</a>, below.</p>
<h2 id="responsibility-and-ownership">Responsibility and Ownership</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether your team operates with a top-down, command-oriented
management structure or with a more self-directed and anarchistic process, for
every task, there is notionally one person currently responsible for ensuring
that the task is completed.</p>
<p>That relationship can change over time; how it does so is probably
team-specific.</p>
<p>There may be other people <em>involved</em> in a task that are not <em>responsible</em> for
a task, in a number of roles. Just because I developed the code for a feature
does not mean I am necessarily responsible for the feature any more, but it
might be useful to have a “developed by” list for the feature's task.</p>
<p>Ways of identifying people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural-language names (“Gianna Grady”)</li>
<li>Email addresses</li>
<li>Login names</li>
<li>Distinguished names in some directory</li>
<li>URLs</li>
</ul>
<p>Task responsibility relationships reflect real-world responsibility, and help
communicate it, but do not normally define it.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>“Workflow” describes both the implications of the states a task can be in and
the implications of the transitions between states. Most task trackers are, at
their core, workflow engines of varying sophistication.</p>
<p>Why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve shared understanding of how tracked tasks are performed.</li>
<li>Provide clear hand-off points when responsibility shifts.</li>
<li>Provide insight into which tasks need what kinds of attention.</li>
<li>Integration points for other behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>States are implicitly time-bounded, and joined to their predecessor and
successor states by transitions.</p>
<p>Task state is decoupled from the real world: the task in a tracker is not the
work it describes.</p>
<p>Elemental states:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Open”: in this state, the task has not yet been completed. Work may or may
  not be ongoing.</li>
<li>“Completed”: in this state, all work on a task has been completed.</li>
<li>“Abandoned”: in this state, no further work on a task will be performed, but
  the task has not been completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most real-world workflows introduce some intermediate states that tie into
process-related handoffs.</p>
<p>For software, I see these divisions, in various combinations, frequently:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Open”:<ul>
<li>“Unverified”: further work needs to be done to decide whether the task
  should be completed.</li>
<li>“In Development”: someone is working on the code and asset changes
  necessary to complete the task. This occasionally subsumes preliminary
  work, too.</li>
<li>“In Testing”: code and asset changes are ostensibly complete,
  but need testing to validate that the task has been completed
  satisfactorially.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Completed”:<ul>
<li>“Development Completed”: work (and possibly testing) has been completed
  but the task's results are not yet available to external users.</li>
<li>“Released”: work has been completed, and external users can see and use
  the results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Abandoned”:<ul>
<li>“Cannot Reproduce”: common in bug/defect tasks, to indicate that the
  task doesn't contain enough information to render the bug fixable.</li>
<li>“Won't Complete”: the task is well-understood and theoretically
  completable, but will not be completed.</li>
<li>“Duplicate”: the task is identical to, or closely related to, some other
  task, such that completing either would be equivalent to completing
  both.</li>
<li>“Invalid”: the task isn't relevant, is incompletely described, doesn't
  make sense, or is otherwise not appropriate work for the team using the
  tracker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are universal.</p>
<p>Transitions show how a task moves from state to state.</p>
<ul>
<li>Driven by external factors (dev work leads to tasks being marked completed)<ul>
<li>Explicit transitions: “mark this task as completed”</li>
<li>Implicit transitions: “This commit also completes these tasks”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drive external factors (tasks marked completed are emailed to testers)</li>
</ul>
<p>States implicitly describe a <em>belief</em> or a <em>desire</em> about the future of the
task, which is a human artifact and may be wrong or overly hopeful. Tasks can
transition to “Completed” or “Abandoned” states when the work hasn't actually
been completed or abandoned, or from “Completed” or “Abandoned” to an “Open”
state to note that the work isn't as done as we thought it was. <em>This is a
feature</em> and trackers that assume every transition is definitely true and
final encourage ugly workarounds like duplicating tickets to reopen them.</p>
<h2 id="speciation">Speciation</h2>
<p>I mentioned above that bugs are a kind of task. The ways in which bugs are
“different” is interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Good bugs have a well-defined reproduction case - steps you can follow to
  demonstrate and test them.</li>
<li>Good bugs have a well-described expected behaviour.</li>
<li>Good bugs have a well-described actual behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to support this kind of highly detailed speciation of task types
without either bloating the tracker with extension points (JIRA) or
shoehorning all features into every task type (Redmine) is hard, but
necessary.</p>
<p>Supporting structure helps if it leads to more interesting or efficient ways
of using tasks to drive and understand work.</p>
<p>Bugs are not the only “special” kind of task:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Feature” tasks show up frequently, and speciate on having room for
  describing specs and scope.</li>
<li>“Support ticket” tasks show up in a few trackers, and speciate dramatically
  as they tend to be tasks describing the work of a single incident rather
  than tasks describing the work on some shared aspect, so they tend to pick
  up fields for relating tickets to the involved parties. (Arguably, incident
  tickets have needs so drastically different that you should use a dedicated
  incident-management tool, not a task/bug tracker.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other kinds are possible, and you've probably seen them in the wild.</p>
<p>Ideally, speciation happens to support <em>widespread</em> specialized needs. Bug
repro is a good example; every task whose goal is to fix a defect should
include a clear understanding of the defect, both to allow it to be fixed and
to allow it to be tested. Adding specialized data for bugs supports that by
encouraging clearer, more structured descriptions of the defect (with implicit
“fix this” as the task).</p>
<h2 id="implementation-notes">Implementation notes</h2>
<p>If we reduce task tracking to “record changes to fields and record discussion
comments, on a per task basis,” we can describe the current state of a ticket
using the “most recent” values of each field and the aggregate of all recorded
comments. This can be done ~2 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Centralized” tracking, where each task has a single, total order of
    changes. Changes are mediated through a centralized service.</li>
<li>“Decentralized” tracking, where each task has only a partial order over the
    history of changes. Changes are mediated by sharing sets of changes, and by
    appending “reconciliation” changes to resolve cases where two incomparable
    changes modify the same field/s. The most obvious partial order is a
    digraph.</li>
</ol>
<p>Centralized tracking is a well-solved problem. Decentralized tracking so far
seems to rely heavily on DSCM tools (Git, Mercurial, Fossil) for resolving
conflicts.</p>
<p>The “work offline” aspect of a distributed tracker is less interesting in as
much as task tracking is a communications tool. Certain kinds of changes
should be published and communicated as early as possible so as to avoid
misunderstandings or duplicated work.</p>
<p>Being able to separate the mechanism of how changes to tasks are recorded from
the policy of which library of tasks is “canonical” is potentially useful as
an editorial tool and for progressive publication to wider audiences as work
progresses.</p>
<p>Issue tracking is considerably more amenable to append-only implementations
than SCM is, even if you dislike history-editing SCM workflows. This suggests
that Git is a poor choice of issue-tracking storage backends...</p>
